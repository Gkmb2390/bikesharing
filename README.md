# Project Overview
    The purpose of the project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing business program would be a good fit for Des Moines.  Reviewing the analyses we have performed to find and present the data points that matter most to the investor - specifically related to strength of the market, as well as, types of trips, lengths of trips and who we should expect to see using our bikes.  

# Results

# User Type Breakdown
    Reviewing the results of the User Types the overwhelming majority of users tend to be subscribers(81%).  Seeing as 4 of 5 users tend to subscribe to similar bike services; we can structure our pricing according to the rough trend.

# Gender Breakdown  
    The number of male users for bike sharing services is well over 50%, while female users account for roughly 25%.  Again understanding the broader audience structure will allow for us to effectively market and manage expectations amongst users as we build our new business. 

# Length of Bike Ridess
    This chart reveals that some very interesting statistics and information regarding the use of our product.  The most popular length of time for a bike rental is shown as 5 minutes.  This allows for us to recognize the general travel distance (in time at least).

    Knowing that a majority of users will be using bike-sharing for relatively short distances; will assist in designating pickup & dropoff points for the bike-sharing service.  Additional data will be needed to make this initial view even more efficeint; reviewing map data of Des Moines to review the most popular areas would be increasing helpful. 

#  Length of Bike Rides by Gender
    Reviewing the length of use for men, women and unknown users will allow us to determine patterns of use.  Which may play a part in repair of bike or quantity of bikes needed at particular locations, if we know that more men, or women reside in a particular area.  Additionally we see an interesting outlier in the data in regards to the "unknown" category of riders their most popular ride length is very nearly 2x that of the Men and Women.

#  Most Popular Times of Use
    The heatmap of the most popular times of day will allow us to see the best times to preform maintence; or alternatively create more competitive pricing for our customer base, which will allow us to manage or increase costs as necessary. 
    
    Unsuprisingly we discover that weekends in the morning to afternoon, roughly 10am to 4pm are rather busy times; while the week days appear to be busiest between 6am to 9am and 5pm to 8pm.  This makes sense as this would be your usual commuting hours to and and from work.  Strangely Wednesday is far less busy than any other day of the week, specifically during those evening commute hours.

#  Most Popular Times by Gender
    There isn't too much new information to be seen here, then what was mentioned previously.  The gender split we see in this chart, matches the gender breakdown chart seen earlier in the report, as such a majority of the traffic is reported under the "Male" gender id.  The women and unkown categories appear to match the heat map, though with greatly reduced values, creating a far more even looking heat map overall.

#   Most Popular times by Gender and User Type
    Diving even deeper into the previous vizuilzation we find that a majority of the users are subscribers to the service - which we learned from the User Type Pie Chart earlier.  
    Additionally the majority of subscribers are also male, as seen in the previous heat map.  
    
    Interestingly we don't see a great deal of uniformity amongst the "customer" group in regards to when they most frequently utilize the bike share service.  Additional analyses would be required, but I would be curious to review the total number of times the "customer" group utilized our services by gender breakdown.  It could identify reasons or way to reach the customers to turn them to subscribers.

# Summary

    While the initial breakdown of data has provided several interesting and useful revelations.  We could dig deeper into this by looking at more geo-focused data within our desired city, Des Moines.  I mentioned earlier in the report that understanding popular or high traffic areas within the city; in tandem with the popular lengths of ride times will allow for more efficient placement of our bike hubs and rental positions. 

    Another view of data that would be helpful is to reveiw the current ridership/user types by Age.  If we looked to the age groupings to see which age groups frequented our services the most.  We could then design marketing and promotional programs to entice the age groups who utilize our service the least; or reward those who utilize it the most.
